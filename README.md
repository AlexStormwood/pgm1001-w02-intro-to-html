# pgm1001-w02-intro-to-html
Module 2 and Module 3 of PGM1001

# Notes

- Make the repo through the GitHub website, NOT through GitHub Desktop
- Use Visual Studio Code, NOT Visual Studio Community
- Don't need a ".gitignore"
- Do want a README file and a LICENSE file 
- "src" folder to contain our source code of our project
- in HTML files, write out "html:5" and select the Emmet abbreviation as a shortcut to writing a heap of boilerplate

# Handy Websites

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [W3Schools HTML Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
- [Cats As A Service (cat photo website)](https://cataas.com/cat)

# Handy Tools

- GitHub - version control, back up and preserve our work 
- Visual Studio Code - coding editor, or "IDE" (integrated development environment)
- GitHub Desktop - a way to synchronise our local work to our online remote copy
